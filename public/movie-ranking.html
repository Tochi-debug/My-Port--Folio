<h1>The Best Anime's According To Bobby</h1>
<h2>My Best 5 Anime Of All Time</h2>
<hr>
 <h3>The Seven Deadly Sins</h3>
 <p>The anime is peak. Especially the part where Meliodas story was told.</p>
 <h3>Re:zero</h3>
 <p>This one is PEAK!, and it made me emotional. Like the part the main character had to die to change the mistakes he made</p>.
 <h3>Let This Greiving Soul Retire!</h3>
 <p>In this anime, the main character starts out as a complete weakling, but with help from his overpowered childhood friends, he eventually becomes the strongest.
Actually, it’s the relics he gathers while adventuring with those powerful childhood friends that make him strong.
The anime is really good.</p>
 <h3>Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation</h3>
 <p>This is the best anime I’ve watched. I’ve rewatched it many times.
The main character is a 32-year-old jobless introvert who hates going out unless he needs to buy something.
Long story short, he dies in a car accident and is reincarnated into another world, born again as a child but with the mindset of his former life.
I really recommend watching this anime — it’s very good.

 <h3>Hunter x Hunter</h3> 
 <p>I learnt alot from this anime, it's really good.</p>
